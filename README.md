CHE201: Assignment 2 
Question 1 (15 marks) 
Draw the   products formed from the following acid   base   pairs and   use approximate   pKa values to   predict   in which direction the equilibrium will   lie.   (3   marks for   each   reaction,   2   for   the   products,   1   for   the equilibrium’s   position)

Question 2 [15 marks]: 
Draw the   mechanism and the   products A and B of the following   reactions.   (7.5   marks   for   each   reaction, 2.5 for the   product, 5 for   the   mechanism)

Question 3 [15 marks]: Using   benzaldehyde   (PhCHO) as your starting   material   provide the   reagents   required to synthesize the   following compounds A, B, and C.   More than one   step   maybe   necessary.   No   mechanisms   required   (5 marks each)
Question 代 写CHE201: Assignment 2
代做程序编程语言4 [15 marks]: 
Provide the   mechanism for the following   reaction   (10   marks). Which   base would   be suitable for this   reaction? Justify your answer   (5   marks)

Question 5 [15 marks]: 
Draw the   mechanism to explain the   regioselectivity of the following   reaction:   (7.5   marks for   the   mechanism, 7.5 for the explanation)

Question 6 [25 marks]: 
Provide the   missing   reagents that   lead to the formation of   product A (5   marks) and   explain   why   you used these   reagents   (5   marks).   Using A as a starting   material   provide the structures   of   products B and C (5   marks each) and draw the   mechanism that   leads to the formation   of   product D.   (5   marks)
